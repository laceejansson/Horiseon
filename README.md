## Refactor

### Change page title

from

    <title>website</title>

to

    <title>Horiseon</title>

within the page head tag


### Use nav tag as semantic element

from

    <div class="header">

to

    <nav class="header">

within the page body tag


### Use footer tag as semantic element

from

    <div class="footer">

to

    <footer class="footer">

as the last tag in the body

### Fix nav bar header tag

from

    <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>

to

    <h1>Horiseon</h1>

within the nav bar

### Fix navbar links

broken links:

    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>

assign the id `search-engine-optimization` to the `<div>` that holds information about search engine optimization

from

    <div class="search-engine-optimization">

to

    <div id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization">

within the nav bar

### Use section semantic element

switch all subsections from `<div>` to `<section>`


### Use summary semantic element

when a summary of a particular topic is used, switch it's tag from `<div>` to `<summary>`


### Add img alt attributes

> The alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it 

if the tag `<img>` is missing `alt=` add it with a short alternate text for the image
